Simple C++ Substitution Cipher and Python Substract Square Game

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a simple substitution cipher in C++ and a Substract Square game in Python.

## Substitution Cipher (C++)

### Description

The C++ code in this repository implements a basic substitution cipher. It encrypts and decrypts messages using a user-defined substitution key.
